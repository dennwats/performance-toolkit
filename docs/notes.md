- `ps` shows live process data like PID, CPU %, and memory usage — useful for identifying resource hogs.
- `lscpu` displays detailed CPU architecture info (cores, sockets, virtualization) — great for hardware baseline and tuning.
- Combined, these tools help monitor both workload activity and system capabilities for top-tier performance.
